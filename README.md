WORK IN PROGRESS

A scalable text-based version of the classic 'Battleship' board game. 

Play on scalable board sizes. 

Strategize and take the enemy out!

## Contributing
Pull requests are open however this is very much a learning oppurtunity for me so I will most likely not accept these requests.

## Development
Pretty straight forward:

> _Clone the repository_ and run _game.py_ ... I know it doesn't have any fancy terminal commands to get the program running ... yet ;)
